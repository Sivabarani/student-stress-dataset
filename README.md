# Student Stress Dataset

This dataset contains details about students and workers from different academic profiles and domain. The goal is to predict the "Depression" column, which indicates whether a student is experiencing depression or not.

**Understanding Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data, where both input features and the output (target variable) are known. In this case, the task is a classification problem, as we aim to predict whether a student is depressed (yes/no) based on various input features.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following columns:

1. id - Unique ID of the student.
2. Gender - Gender of the student (Male/Female).
3. Age - Age of the student.
4. City - Region where the student resides.
5. Profession - The student’s current profession (Student/Working Professional).
6. Academic Pressure - The level of academic pressure the student experiences.
7. Work Pressure - The level of work pressure experienced by the student if they are working.
8. CGPA - Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the student. Low CGPA may contribute to higher depression levels.
9. Study Satisfaction - The student's satisfaction with their studies (on a scale or as a categorical variable).
10. Job Satisfaction - The student's satisfaction with their job (for working professionals).
11. Sleep Duration - The duration of sleep the student gets.
12. Dietary Habits - The student’s dietary habits, including whether they are on a specific diet.
13. Degree - The type of degree the student is pursuing.
14. Have You Ever Had Suicidal Thoughts? - Whether the student has ever experienced suicidal thoughts (Yes/No).
15. Work/Study Hours - The number of hours the student spends working/studying.
16. Financial Stress - Whether the student experiences financial stress.
17. Family History of Mental Illness - Whether the student has a family history of mental health issues.
18. Depression - The target variable indicating whether the student is depressed (Yes/No).

**Objective**
The goal of this analysis is to predict the "Depression" status of participants. While the "Depression" column is the target variable, the dataset also provides an opportunity to explore the relationships between other features (independent variables) and depression levels.

**Understanding Data Relationships:**

**1. _Dependent Variable:_**
The "Depression" column is the outcome we are trying to predict, indicating whether the student is depressed or not.

**2. _Independent Variables:_**
All other columns are considered independent variables that may influence depression, including:

Age, Gender, Academic Pressure, Work Pressure, CGPA, Study Satisfaction, Job, Satisfaction, Sleep, Duration, Dietary, Habits, Degree, Suicidal Thoughts, Work/Study Hours, Financial Stress, Family History of Mental Illness.

These independent variables may help predict whether or not a student is depressed, and understanding their relationship with the dependent variable is key to building an effective predictive model.
